# Experiment Plan (Group Homework) SOC412
In this assignment, due *April 26* at 5:00pm, your team will submit a plan describing your class experiment. This draft will be a central component of the final that you submit at the end of the class. A good experiment plan for this class will include the following information:

* The scientific/pragmatic motivation for this study
* Something about the research context
* A full description of the research procedure, including:
  * The population in the study
  * The sample size you anticipate, justified with reference to your power analysis
  * The steps in the research process, including steps related to research ethics
  * Every variable that you are recording, and how
  * The main outcomes
  * The estimation procedures, along with the direction of any effect you expect

I have posted [an example experiment plan from the Social Media Color Experiment](https://osf.io/fe3vj/) to the Open Science Framework.

Since this will eventually be a public document, you may wish to include a section on research ethics, since the public may be curious about how you thought about those issues.

You may submit this document as a collaboratively-editable document (Overleaf and Google Docs are fine). I have included templates for Overleaf and for Word in this folder. 

For April 26, this does not need to be a final or full document. I expect that it will change as you move toward the final. However, you do need to include as much as possible. For April 26, your weekly team report should include a plan for how you intend to complete the experiment plan in the remaining time. 

Based on what you submit on April 26, I will work with your team to determine an achievable set of expectations for your final project due on May 14th.
