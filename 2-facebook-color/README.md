## Background

In this class assigment, carried out in teams of two or three, you will be expected to carry out a randomized trial over a 1-2 week period, combine data from your findings, analyze the results, and report what you found. The basic structure of the Social Media Color experiment is based on the [Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/blob/master/1-facebook-poem/README.md) from last week. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a first opportunity to conduct an experiment live on the web.

## Study Procedure
To conduct this study, you will need to carry out the following procedures:

* Each person on your team should pick something that you could routinely be expected to share on social media most days (a description of your food, a quote, a joke)
* Each person on the team publishes a post once a day:
  * Randomly assign that post to receive a **plain** or [**color** background](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/facebook-status-background-color/)
  * Make a record about the message you are about to post:
    * Record the number of characters used in your message (the spreadsheet has example code. If you prefer not to share the text of your messages, just enter the number)
    * Predict the popularity of the post and enter the value in the spreadsheet *(from 1 to 5 where 1 means that you expect no one to engage, and 5 means you expect the post to be among your most popular)*
  * Make a record about the previous day's message at the same time you make a new post, roughly after 24 hours:
    * The number of Likes, Shares, and Comments received by the item
    * If you miss a day, record NONE under LIKES/COMMENTS/SHARES (try very hard not to miss a day)
  * Hold off on commenting over the next 24 hours
  * Do not click "like" on these posts when you see that other students have made comments (or click "like" every time, no matter what)
* At the end of the assignment:
  * Combine data with your partner(s)
  * Use [the code and statistics from the Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/tree/master/1-facebook-poem) to calculate your results
  * Write an essay similar to the one you wrote in week one, based on your own data

Data about the study can be stored in an Excel spreadsheet like the one in this folder (*Facebook Color RCT Example Spreadsheet SOC 412.xls*), or it can be stored using a copy of [this Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6j_AURC_VluabPciCSp0Mv0HCtmLqZUt6eXemO27dw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Research Ethics and Privacy

If you carry out this study, you will be added to the research as a co-investigator and will have access to data from this study. Here are other things you will want to know:

* This course includes assignments that involve other students analyzing data from this study
* Findings from this study will be submitted to an academic publications focused on teaching statistics and data science. Students are encouraged to be co-authors on this paper, if you are interested
* Data from this course will be made public as part of open access classroom materials and as part of any academic publications about this collective study. The dataset will include:
  * Anonymized team ID
  * Anonymized Experimenter ID
  * Condition
  * Text Length
  * Likes
  * Comments
  * Shares
  * Interactions
  * Popularity Prediction
  * Number of Facebook Friends, fuzzed with a +-20 randomly-sampled integer to limit re-identification
  
If you do not feel comfortable conducting this study in your own social network, you will be provided with an alternative assignment, the [Cornhole Challenge](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/tree/master/2-cornhole-challenge). You will need to agree with your partner on which assignment to take on, so please make a decision ASAP. Declining to conduct this study will not reflect on your grades and will not affect your standing with the instructor, your department, or Princeton University.
