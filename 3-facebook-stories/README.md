**SOC 412: Designing Field Experiments at Scale**

In this experiment, we randomly assign topics to be posted for discussion using either a public Facebook post (public on the internet, persists forever) or a Facebook story (only among friends, disappears in 24 hours).

## Background
In this class assigment, carried out in teams of two or three, you will be expected to carry out a randomized trial over a 1-2 week period, combine data from your findings, analyze the results, and report what you found. The basic structure of this experiment is based on the [Facebook Poem Experiment](https://github.com/natematias/SOC412/blob/master/1-facebook-poem/README.md) from last week. The purpose of this assignment is to give you a first opportunity to conduct an experiment live on the web.


## Purposes of the assignment
This assignment will support you to:

* Complete a full field experiment from start to finish in three weeks
* Think about the ethics of experimentation with the people in your life, as a precursor to doing experiments in other people's lives
* Debrief people about the experiment process
* Communicate experiment results to a public audience
* Collect data that we will be able to use to analyze multiple field experiments together

## Study Procedure
To conduct this study, you will need to carry out the following procedure:

* Each person on your team should make a list of 22 things you would like to ask your friends on social media to discuss (questions, topics, personal stories, clothing, music albums, films, poems, which thing people prefer out of two). What's important is that the question type be something that you think people would be more likely to talk about if the messages disappeared after 24 hours. Each of these should have an image associated with them.
  * If you need to make an image from text, you can use [one of these image creators](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/quote-maker-apps-instagram). I'm using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Make all of the images in advance, and make sure that the font sizes are the same acros all of them.
  * You will be making the first comment with your opinion/answer/reaction. So you should pre-write your first comment as well.
* Use Facebook's [Custom Privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/help/459934584025324) to **exclude anyone who you know who is younger than 18 years old**. Whenever you make a post in this experiment, please use the "Friends Except" feature and select this exclusion list (read more about [Facebook's restricted lists](https://www.facebook.com/help/200538509990389?helpref=faq_content)).
* This procedure should also work on Instagram and Messenger

* Each person on the team **publishes an image post once a day**:
  * Randomly assign that post to be **removed after 24 hours** or **remain in your feed after 24 hours**
  * Include information about the post's privacy in the image
  * Include the question in the text of the post as well. Example:
    * Today's question is: "What childhood object inspired you?"
  * The first response should be a note from you, answering the question yourself
  * You should click "like" on every comment
  * Do not reply to comments on your post over the next 24 hours
  * If you see a classmate's post, **do not react or comment** to it.
* Every time you post, you should also:
  * Make a record about the previous's day's message at the same time you make a new post, roughly 24 hours later
  * For posts where you promised to remove the conversation after 24 hours, remove the post **after** recording the results
  
Data about the study can be stored in an Excel spreadsheet like the one in this folder (*Facebook Color RCT Example Spreadsheet SOC 412.xls*), or it can be stored using a copy of [this Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z6j_AURC_VluabPciCSp0Mv0HCtmLqZUt6eXemO27dw/edit?usp=sharing).
